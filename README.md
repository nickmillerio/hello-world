# hello-world
This is my hangout+everything else

Hi, Guys!

Nick here, I am just getting into programming in general.
As a matter of fact I'm hanging out at codeschool.com to get the feel for it.
I'm starting at rails now. First hour and I can already tell it is an art!

Looking forward to working with people to build cool things to use.
